# Unity-Prototype
First prototype of a player controller

Controls are set for Dualshock 4, gonna be available for keyboard shortly.

Left stick - horizontal movement
Right stick - weapon aim
X - jump
O - interaction with objects (interactive objects are colored in green, when they are reachable they become red)
Triangle - changing grabity direction
R1 - environment gravity (switch/not switch)
L1 - player gravity (switch/not switch)
R2 - shoot (might have some delay before/after a shot - depends on modified value)

First version uses Old Input System. Until it is made into the New one, you should press NO before the editor gets loaded.
